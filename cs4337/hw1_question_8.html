    <p>About me: I am an undergraduate student from the University of Texas at Dallas with a highly-experienced professional software developer with more than 3 years of experience. Having a good understanding of both <b> data structures and Algorithm Analysis</b>. I have skilled in designing, testing, and developing web-based software with programming language in <b>java</b> and <b>python</b> I am currently working as a teaching assistant at the campus network department. This role and responsibility have helped him shape into a self-starter and understand the importance of teamwork. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require him to work outside my comfort and knowledge set. <i>I think long term and does not sacrifice long-term value for short-term</i>. He is never done learning and always seeks any possible way to improve himself. I show great passion for computer science knowledge and regularly searches and learn new technologies.</p>
